# Drum Kit
This works is that we've got a number of keys here that represent different drums in
a typical drum set.
And when you click on any of these buttons then you'll get the corresponding sound of the drum.
And in addition you can also use the keys on the keyboard.

<h2>Tools Used</h2>
Used JavaScript event handlers, animations and audio files for the drum sound. Also used HTML5 and CSS3.

<h2>Screenshots</h2>
